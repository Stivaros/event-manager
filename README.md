# README

This app was a small tutorial app I wrote in 2019 while following [this guide](https://hibbard.eu/rails-react-crud-app/).

It is a Ruby on Rails backend with React frontend application, where React is running via Webpacker within the same repo.

I followed the tutorial as I wanted to see how to integrate a frontend framework into a Rails application without using separate repos or a microservice architecture.

You are welcome to use my code but please note I am not maintaining this repo, dependencies are not being patched for security.
